    <string name="fact_1_title">First Album Recorded in Space</string>
    <string name="fact_1_desc">Astronaut Chris Hadfield became the first person to record a music video in open space — aboard the ISS, he performed a cover of David Bowie’s “Space Oddity”. Even more surprisingly, he later released a full album, *“Space Sessions: Songs from a Tin Can”*, partially recorded in zero gravity.</string>
    <string name="fact_2_title">Song for Free</string>
    <string name="fact_2_desc">In 2007, Radiohead released the album “In Rainbows” on a “pay what you want” basis — including $0. Many downloaded it for free, but the average payment was $6. This revolutionized the industry and marked the beginning of the era of digital trust between artists and fans.</string>
    <string name="fact_3_title">Banned for Optimism</string>
    <string name="fact_3_desc">In 1985, Soviet authorities banned the song “We Are the World” (USA for Africa), claiming lyrics “over-idealize humanity” and allegedly “undermine class vigilance”. Meanwhile, in the USSR, copies were secretly distributed on X-ray film — known as “bone records”.</string>
    <string name="fact_4_title">Melody That Treats Parkinson’s Disease</string>
    <string name="fact_4_desc">Studies show that rhythmic music helps Parkinson’s patients regain gait and coordination. The brain synchronizes with the rhythm — effectively “rebooting” motor functions. In some clinics, music therapy is even used as part of treatment.</string>
